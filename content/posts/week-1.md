## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running

This week I started running with a goal of achieving a 7 minute mile by my birthday, May 25th. My benchmark time on Monday was a 7:55(oof). To achieve this, I'm planning to run 4-5 times a week with warmup and cooldown. I'm breaking up the mile into 400m blocks with rest in between.

Tuesday, I began using the 400 method. Doing that I got 7:08:47 which is only 8 seconds off of my goal. In the past when i've been running, I never warmed up or cooled down. However, I think I will injure myself if I run 4-5 times a week and don't take care of my legs.

#### Run 400x4 @1:30 w/ 1:30 rest:

## ü¶ä Melee


This week I'm reestablishing my melee goals to achieve Gold in netplay by December. I don't want to practice on my computer because it lags (very frustrating) so i'm waiting for an SD card to arrive to Robbinsville to format my Wii with UnclePunch. 

When I begin practicing again, i'm going to focus on mastering fundamentals. To do this, I'll start by practice Leffen's suggestions for 30 minutes a day:
 - Movement
   - Dash dancing across the stage, platforms
   - Jumping onto platforms on different stages w/ waveland
 - Punishes
   - Drill waveshine upsmash
   - Chaingrab
   - Upthrow upair

Fundamentals movement and execution is important. However, I also want to try making macro-scale adjustments such as abstaining from wavedashing (Chi), abstaining from following up on ambiguous situations where i could take center or reposition instead (Graham), making sure I don't try to hit falco from above (Simon), etc. 

#### 30 min fundamentals, 30 min beat up CPU * 3:

## üíª Coding

I worked on an idea for coding Gundam as a US intervention RPG. I'm planning to finish fleshing out the wireframes this week. However, I still don't know go. I wonder if it's a good idea to code a calculator first? That would be a great way to refresh my coding skills and produce a small working example. Nah sounds lame i'm just gonna make Gundam game lmao.

Despite not having finished the book yet, I want to begin coding anyway. At the least, I think I could create a basic 2D controllable player by the end of the week.

#### 30 min/day of coding go-gundam
